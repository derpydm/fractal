# fractal
Fractal is an iOS scientific calculator.

It has a history page and basic functionality (of a scientific calculator). Settings such as significant figures (up to 15sf for Doubles) and angle measurement (degree/radians) are available.

# What?
Fractal was my application for the inaugral Swift Innovators' Summit (https://swiftinsg.org).

# Credits
Fractal uses DDMathParser by Dave DeLong to parse calculations.
